Our platform provides flexible and secure control over your API keys to ensure you have full oversight of your integrations.

### ✅ Activating & Deactivating API Keys

You can toggle the status of any API key between **Active** and **Inactive** using the **Status Toggle Button**.

- **Active**: The API key is valid and can be used to authenticate requests, including creating new orders.
- **Inactive**: The API key is temporarily disabled. Any request made using a deactivated key — including order creation — will be rejected until the key is reactivated.

> This feature allows you to pause access without permanently deleting the key, which is useful for testing, maintenance, or security purposes.

### 🗑️ Deleting API Keys

You may also **permanently delete** any API key that is no longer needed by using the **Delete** button 🗑️.

- Once deleted, the API key **cannot be recovered or used**.
- Any system or integration relying on the deleted key for payment operations will no longer be able to process transactions.

> Be cautious when deleting API keys, especially those actively used in live environments.

### 🛡️ Best Practices

- **Deactivate** keys not in use to minimize exposure.
- **Rotate** keys periodically for enhanced security.
- **Delete** unused or compromised keys immediately.

By managing your API keys responsibly, you help ensure the integrity and security of your integrations.
