## Test Mode vs Live Mode

When integrating the crypto payment checkout system, it's important to understand the two primary operational modes: **Test Mode** and **Live Mode**. Each mode serves a distinct purpose during the development and deployment lifecycle.

---

## 🧪 Test Mode

Test Mode is used during development to simulate transactions without using real cryptocurrency.

- **Purpose**: Development, debugging, and integration testing.
- **Behavior**:
  - No real funds are involved.
  - Simulates full checkout and payment flow.
  - Uses test wallets and test tokens.
  - Enables testing of webhooks and callback URLs.
- **API Keys**: Use **Test API Keys** from your developer dashboard.
- **Environment**: Set your application to run in `Sandbox` mode (this can be found at the top right ).

> Test Mode ensures your system behaves correctly before going live.

## 🚀 Live Mode

Live Mode is for production. It processes real payments from real customers using blockchain transactions.

- **Purpose**: Production use and real payments.
- **Behavior**:
  - Executes real crypto transfers on the blockchain.
  - Webhooks and callbacks are fired in real-time.
  - Should only be used when fully tested and ready.
- **API Keys**: Use **Live API Keys**.
- **Environment**: Set your environment to `live`.

> Be sure all endpoints and configurations are correct before enabling Live Mode.

## 🔁 Switching Between Modes

You can easily toggle between **Test Mode** and **Live Mode** by using the environment switcher located at the **top right corner of the dashboard**.

1. Click the mode toggle (Sandbox/Live) at the top right.
2. The system will automatically update your current environment.
3. Make sure to use the correct API keys for the selected mode.
4. Verify your webhook endpoints and other configurations.

> This allows you to safely test features without affecting real users or funds.

By utilizing both modes correctly, you can confidently test your crypto payment flows before accepting real payments from users.
